A design of MIPS processor using VHDL that illustrates a basic computer system by simulating the data and control paths.

First thing that was implemented in the processor was the MIPS register file that reads simultaneously from two registers and write into another.

Then I added the 32 bit full ALU to do the basic operations of addition and substraction according to ALUop which I've added.

Then I designed a simple MIPS CPU Using VHDL. The CPU is able to perform certain instructions: R-type (AND, OR, ADD, SUB, SLT and NOR), I-type (lw, sw, beq, bne) and J instruction.
